## Lab Session Note (Please Read)

A few students mentioned that the project uploaded to GitHub **does not run on their machine** and they’re not sure why.

Please **come to the lab and go through the tutorial in person**. The full setup procedure is **not difficult**, and it involves **no coding** — but it does require doing the steps in the correct order. If something is missed (e.g., a dependency, a platform setting, or a permission), the project may fail to run.

### Important notes
- **Some required files are too large to be stored on GitHub**, so they are **not included in this repository**.
  - You will need to **download these files yourself** (instructions are covered in the lab tutorial).
- **Vuforia access (login/registration)** can feel a bit annoying or complex the first time, but it’s a **one-time setup**.
  - Once it’s done, you’ll be able to access a lot of useful features and content to test and explore.

✅ **Recommendation:** Please follow the lab tutorial step-by-step during the session. If you do it in the lab, we can quickly help you spot what’s missing and get everything running smoothly.
